# In scikit-learn a random split into training and test sets can be quickly computed with the train_test_split helper function.

# Before doing this, we need to decide what to do about an unbalanced data set. We can have three strategies for investigating unbalanced data sets.

# Lets start by looking at the scikit-learn-contrib inbalanced-learn
#
# We want to loop over multiple learners to see how they perform
#
# We want to loop over mulitple learning rates to see how they perform
